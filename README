MD-scripts:
Scripts used for the preparation of topology and coordinate files, and for NAMD simulations.

AF-inputs:
Topology and coordinate files for the AF simulations.

crys-inputs:
Topology and coordinate files for the crys simulations.

analysis-scripts:
All cpptraj scripts for structural analysis of the MD ensembles.

CSG-library:
AMBER library file for the S-glutathionylated cysteine residue.
The parameters are usable like any other AMBER parameter file when building the topology and coordinates files of the system.
If you want to know more about how to build these files to further perform MD simulations of S-glutathionylated proteins, we recommend the AMBER tutorials: https://ambermd.org/tutorials/BuildingSystems.php

Supplementary_Information:
Supplementary information pdf file with figures and tables.
